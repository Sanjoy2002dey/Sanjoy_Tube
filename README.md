Live Link: https://sanjoy-tube.vercel.app/

=> Sanjoy-Tube is a modern and lightweight frontend clone of YouTube, built using React + Vite.

=> This project fetches real-time data using the YouTube Data API, including videos, channels, comments, recommendations, and more — giving users a smooth and dynamic YouTube-like experience.

=> I created this project to practice real-world API integration, improve my UI/UX skills, and get hands-on experience building production-ready frontend applications.

✨ What This Project Does:
This is not a simple static clone — it includes real functionalities such as:

▶️ Playing videos with an embedded YouTube player

📺 Showing recommended videos

👤 Displaying channel details & subscriber count

💬 Fetching real YouTube comments

⏳ Showing video upload time using moment.js

📊 View count & like count formatting

🎨 Smooth and clean YouTube-style UI
